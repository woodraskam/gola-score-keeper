## Technical Requirements

### TR-001: Architecture
**Description**: The scoring interface must integrate seamlessly with existing Gola Score Keeper architecture
**Components**:
- Frontend Component: React/Vue.js or vanilla JavaScript interface with WebSocket connectivity
- Backend API: RESTful endpoints for shot recording and contestant data retrieval
- Real-time Engine: WebSocket server for broadcasting score updates to connected clients

### TR-002: Integration
**Description**: The interface must integrate with existing system components for data consistency
**APIs**:
- Contestant API: GET /api/contestant/current for active contestant information
- Scoring API: POST /api/shots/record for shot result submission
- WebSocket API: Real-time updates for score changes and leaderboard modifications

### TR-003: Data Management
**Description**: The interface must handle shot data efficiently with proper persistence and retrieval
**Data Models**:
- Shot Record: contestant_id, shot_result, timestamp, session_id, operator_id
- Scoring Session: session_id, contestant_id, start_time, shot_count, goal_count
- Real-time Update: update_type, contestant_data, score_data, timestamp

### TR-004: User Interface Framework

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must operate on existing MacBook Air hardware with Apple Silicon processors
- Interface must function offline with local data storage during network outages
- WebSocket connections limited by browser concurrent connection limits
- Local SQLite database storage constraints for shot history data

### Business Constraints
- Interface must be operational for 8-hour trade show events without restart
- Booth operator training time limited to 15 minutes maximum
- System must handle peak usage of 200+ contestants per event day

### Regulatory Constraints
- GDPR compliance required for contestant data handling and storage
- Accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards for public use
- Data retention policies must allow for post-event analytics and reporting

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Contestant Management System: Must be operational for contestant data retrieval
