- [ ] Prevent duplicate competitor registration based on badge ID
- [ ] Validate data integrity before database insertion
- [ ] Support updating competitor information for corrections

### FR-003: Historical Query and Retrieval
**Description**: The system shall provide efficient querying capabilities for retrieving competitor history, generating leaderboards, and accessing historical performance data with response times under 100ms for standard queries.
**Priority**: High
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Retrieve competitor by badge ID in <100ms
- [ ] Generate ranked leaderboard for top N competitors
- [ ] Query attempt history for specific competitors
- [ ] Filter results by date range, company, or score threshold
- [ ] Support pagination for large result sets

### FR-004: Data Export Capabilities
**Description**: The system shall support exporting competitor data and historical records in multiple formats (CSV, JSON) for integration with external systems and post-event analysis.
**Priority**: Medium
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Export all competitor data in CSV format
- [ ] Export structured data in JSON format
- [ ] Include configurable field selection for exports
- [ ] Support filtered exports by date range or criteria
- [ ] Generate export files with proper encoding (UTF-8)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Performance
**Description**: The database system must deliver high-performance operations suitable for real-time scoring applications with multiple concurrent users during trade show events.
**Metrics**:
- Response time: <100ms for single record queries, <2 seconds for complex leaderboard generation
- Throughput: Support 200+ concurrent contestant lookups per minute
- Resource usage: <500MB memory footprint, <10GB disk space for 1000+ competitors

### NFR-002: Reliability
**Description**: The database system must provide high reliability and data durability to prevent data loss during extended trade show operations.
**Implementation**:
- Data durability: Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode enabled for crash recovery
- Backup strategy: Automated incremental backups every hour during events
- Error recovery: Graceful handling of database lock timeouts and connection failures

### NFR-003: Scalability
**Description**: The database must scale efficiently to handle growing datasets throughout multi-day events while maintaining consistent performance.
**User Experience**:
- Data volume: Support 1000+ competitors with 5000+ total attempts
- Query performance: Maintain <2 second response times as dataset grows
- Storage efficiency: Implement data compression and archiving for historical records

## Technical Requirements

### TR-001: Database Architecture
**Description**: Implement SQLite-based local database with optimized schema design, proper indexing, and transaction management for the Gola Score Keeper application.
**Components**:
- Database Engine: SQLite 3.40+ with CGO bindings for Go integration
- Schema Design: Normalized tables with appropriate relationships and constraints
- Connection Management: Connection pooling with configurable timeout and retry logic

### TR-002: Integration with Application Components
**Description**: Seamlessly integrate database operations with existing badge scanning, score tracking, and leaderboard generation modules.
**APIs**:
- Badge Scanner Integration: Store contestant data immediately upon successful badge scan
- Score Tracking Integration: Record attempts in real-time as scores are captured
- Leaderboard Service: Provide ranked data for real-time display updates

### TR-003: Data Management and Schema
**Description**: Design and implement comprehensive data models supporting all competitor tracking requirements with proper validation and constraints.
**Data Models**:
- Contestants Table: Primary key (badge_id), name, company, email, registration_timestamp
- Attempts Table: Foreign key to contestants, score, attempt_number, timestamp, device_id
- Indexes: Composite indexes on (badge_id, timestamp), (score DESC), (company, score DESC)

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must use SQLite for local storage (no external database dependencies)
- Database file must be portable across macOS systems
- CGO must be enabled for SQLite3 Go driver compilation
- Maximum database file size limited to 10GB for performance
- Single-writer, multiple-reader access pattern required

### Business Constraints
- Zero network connectivity requirements for core operations
- Must operate reliably during 8-hour trade show events
- Database operations cannot interrupt real-time scoring workflow
- Data export must complete within 5 minutes for post-event processing

### Regulatory Constraints
- GDPR compliance for EU contestant data handling
- Data retention policies for automatic cleanup after events
- Audit logging for all database modifications
- Secure handling of personally identifiable information (PII)

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Badge Scanner Module: Provides contestant identification and registration data
- Score Tracking Engine: Supplies attempt results and performance metrics
- Web Interface Layer: Consumes database queries for leaderboard display
- Export Module: Requires database query results for report generation

### External Dependencies
- SQLite3 Database Engine: Core database functionality and SQL processing
- Go SQLite Driver: github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 for database connectivity
- Database Migration Library: github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4 for schema management
- CGO Compiler: Required for SQLite3 driver compilation on macOS

## Assumptions
- Application runs on single macOS device (no distributed database requirements)
- Maximum 1000 competitors per event with average 5 attempts each
- Badge IDs are unique identifiers provided by trade show badge system
- Network connectivity available for optional data synchronization (not required for core operations)
- Database file stored on local SSD with sufficient read/write performance
- Single application instance accessing database (no concurrent application conflicts)

## Risks

### High Risk
- **Risk**: Database file corruption during unexpected system shutdown or power loss
  **Mitigation**: Enable WAL mode, implement regular automated backups, add database integrity checks on startup

- **Risk**: Performance degradation with large datasets during extended multi-day events
  **Mitigation**: Implement query optimization, add database maintenance routines, monitor performance metrics

### Medium Risk
- **Risk**: SQLite locking issues during concurrent read/write operations
  **Mitigation**: Configure appropriate busy timeout, implement retry logic, use WAL mode for better concurrency

- **Risk**: Disk space exhaustion from large competitor datasets and attempt history
  **Mitigation**: Implement data archiving, add disk space monitoring, configure automatic cleanup policies

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Database stores and retrieves all competitor data with 100% accuracy
- [ ] Query response times meet performance requirements (<100ms for lookups, <2s for leaderboards)
- [ ] System handles 200+ competitors with 1000+ attempts without performance degradation
- [ ] Zero data loss during normal operation and graceful recovery from system failures
- [ ] Successful integration with all existing application components (badge scanner, score tracker, web interface)
- [ ] Data export functionality produces correctly formatted files for external system integration
- [ ] Database operations complete without blocking real-time scoring workflow
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>80%) for all database operations and error conditions
